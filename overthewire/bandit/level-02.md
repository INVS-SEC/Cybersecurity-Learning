## Objective
Get a password from a "-" filename

## Approach
- Used `ls` to find the file name
- Used `cat < -` to get the credentials

## Commands / Tools

```bash
ls
cat < -
```
Reasoning - `ls` - lists the files in a directory
          - `cat < - opens the dashed file

Result - Resolved credentials for level 2
